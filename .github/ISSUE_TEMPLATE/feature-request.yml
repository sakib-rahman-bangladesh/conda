        ### Thanks for helping Conda! üêç

        Going through feature requests and issues takes up a lot of time, so please be so kind and take a few minutes to fill out all the areas to the best of your ability.

        There will always be more great ideas than there is time to do them, and so we will need to selectively close issues that don't provide enough information, so we can focus our time on helping people like you who fill out the form completely. Thank you for your collaboration!

        There are also already a lot of open requests, so please take 2 minutes and search through existing ones to see if your idea already exists. If you find something close, please upvote that request and comment

        Thanks for helping Conda be amazing. We are nothing without people like you helping build a better community üíê!

        ### Lets make sure you are in the right place. If you have an idea/request for:

        - #### anaconda.org access and service:

          &rarr; file a new issue on the [anaconda.org contact page](https://anaconda.org/contact/report)
